## Installation


Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it, then:

```

```

## Usage

### Full Pipeline

1. Specify the starting image and song using the config file.


2. The scripts can be used on one program to run the full `image --> video --> lip synced video` process all in one command:

```bash
python main.py
```


### Individual Steps
You can also run each step separately:

1. Create video:
```bash
python step1_image_to_video.py
```
The ouput will include a video ID, save it.

2. Add lip sync (using video ID from step 1):
```bash
python step2_lip_sync.py
```
It will ask for the video ID from step 1
The output will include a Task ID. Save it.

### Check Existing Task
```bash
python check_task.py
# Enter task ID when prompted
# Choose task type: 'image2video' or 'lip-sync'
```


## Configuration
Edit `config.py` to change:
- API credentials
- Model settings
- Input/output paths
